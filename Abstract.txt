The 'CM4 Blinky' project is a simple program for the LPC4357
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB4300' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

This example demonstrates how to configure dual core application project
in order to use Cortex-M0 (CM0) core together with the Cortex-M4 (CM4) core.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL =  12.00 MHz
   - CPU  = 180.00 MHz (CM0 and CM4 are running with the same clock frequency)

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED PD_10 is toggled with the speed depending on SysTick Timer interrupt period

 - LED PD_13 is toggled using Cortex-M0 core event interrupt
 
 - CM4 application must load CM0 application image into LPC4350 internal RAM
   and release CM0 core from reset. CM0 application image can be found in the
   file CM0_Image.c which is build using CM0 Blinky project.

 - SEV instruction is used to trigger core event interrupt


The CM4 Blinky program is available for different targets:

  LPC4357 Flash:       configured for on-chip Flash
                       Valid Flash Signature is created with ElfDwT tool.
                       See "Options for Target" - "User")

  LPC4357 RAM:         runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (may be used for target debugging)

  LPC4357 Ext. Flash:  runs from NOR Flash located on board
                       (used for production or target debugging)
                       Set jumpers for boot pins to boot from External Flash
                       and press RESET button while holding down ISP button!
